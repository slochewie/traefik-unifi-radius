# Unifi Controller, Radius, Daloradius, Mariadb and Traefik
https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/unifi-controller

This is a work in progress.
End result will be a Docker stack containing Unifi Controller, Radius, Daloradius and Mariadb.


Both Unifi Controller and Radius will be behind a Traefik reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

Radius will allow Unifi Captive Portal and WPA Enterprise logins.

Unifi controller and Daloradius will each need a dedicated URL such as unifi.example.com and radius.example.com.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/docker/
```
```
cd $HOME/docker/
```
```
git clone https://github.com/slochewie/unifi-radius.git
```
```
cd $HOME/docker/unifi-radius
```
## Letsencrypt Configuration option
- Traefik revese proxy with autogenerated Let's Encrypt SSL certs.
- Use for secure Internet facing sites.

Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and populate all fields in the `COMMON` and `LETSENCRYPT` sections.

Create a link in order to append `docker-compose.letsencrypt.yml` to future docker-compose commands.

```bash
ln -sf docker-compose.letsencrypt.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

Review the merged configs by running:
```
docker-compose config
```
Pull the images:
```
docker-compose pull
```
Configure and start containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
